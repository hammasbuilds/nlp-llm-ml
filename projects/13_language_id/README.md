Language identification is described as solved, and on a paragraph it is. The accuracy
quoted is almost always measured on **documents**; the thing the method is used for is a
search query, a tweet, a log line, a code snippet — inputs an order of magnitude shorter.

Three classes, all from the local cache: **English prose** (HotpotQA, 10.3M characters),
**C source** (Devign, 5.4M) and **Python source** (MBPP + HumanEval, 198k). Profiles built
from 70% of each class; every test snippet cut from a document the profile never saw.

Three standard identifiers over the same profiles:

| | |
|---|---|
| `cavnar_trenkle` | Cavnar & Trenkle (1994) rank-order distance — order only, no probabilities |
| `naive_bayes` | multinomial Naive Bayes over character n-grams, in log space |
| `compression` | which class profile compresses the input best |

---

## Results

Accuracy against input length. Chance is 0.333.

| chars | `cavnar_trenkle` | `naive_bayes` | `compression` |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **10** | **0.796** | 0.788 | 0.718 |
| 20 | 0.876 | 0.960 | 0.844 |
| 40 | 0.936 | 0.982 | 0.930 |
| 80 | 0.948 | 0.989 | 0.966 |
| 160 | 0.962 | 0.994 | 0.986 |
| 320 | 0.973 | 0.997 | 0.992 |
| **640** | 0.981 | **0.997** | 0.994 |

**0.997 at 640 characters, 0.788 at ten — a fall of 0.209 for a 64× shorter input.**

At ten characters, one in five short strings is assigned to the wrong language. That is not
a failure of the method; it is the method being asked a question the input cannot answer.
A ten-character window holds perhaps three n-grams the profile has ever seen.

The practical reading: an accuracy quoted for a language identifier is meaningless without
the length it was measured at, and the lengths people measure at are not the lengths people
use.

## The ranking flips with length

At 640 characters `naive_bayes` wins by 0.016 over `cavnar_trenkle`. **At ten characters
`cavnar_trenkle` wins** — 0.796 against 0.788.

The mechanism is in how each handles an unseen n-gram. Cavnar-Trenkle charges a fixed
penalty equal to the profile size; Naive Bayes charges `log(alpha / denominator)`, which on
a large profile is a much heavier penalty. With plenty of evidence that severity is an
advantage — it sharpens the separation. With three n-grams it is not, because almost
everything is unseen and the score becomes a count of absences rather than a reading of
presences.

So the oldest and simplest method here is the best one at the length that matters most, and
it would never be chosen on a document-length benchmark. **A method selected on long inputs
is not selected for short ones.**

`compression` is worst at ten characters (0.718) for the same reason amplified: it needs
enough input to find something to reference in the profile, and ten bytes appended to eight
kilobytes of context barely moves the compressed size.

---

## The hard pair is not the one that looks hard

The expectation going in — written into the code before the run — was that **C and Python**
would be the hard pair. They share braces, operators, English keywords and identifier
conventions that neither shares with prose.

Confusion matrix, `naive_bayes` at 40 characters, rows are truth:

| | c | english | python |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **c** | 0.99 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| **english** | 0.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| **python** | 0.01 | 0.03 | 0.96 |

**The two programming languages are essentially never confused with each other.** Both are
mistaken for English, and only in that direction — worst confusion is Python read as English
at 3.0%, against 1.3% for the C/Python pair.

Why, once measured: a forty-character window of source code is often *entirely* identifiers,
keywords and comment text, which is English. What separates C from Python is punctuation
density and indentation, and those survive truncation intact. What separates code from prose
is a vocabulary that a short enough window simply does not contain.

The run reads the worst confusion off the matrix rather than asserting which pair it will
be — because the first version of this project hardcoded the C/Python claim and would have
shipped a sentence the data contradicts.

## Limitations

- **Three classes, and two of them are programming languages.** This is not a multilingual
  language identifier. No multilingual corpus is available offline here, so the register
  contrast — prose against two code languages — is what could be measured honestly rather
  than what would be most representative.
- **Python is the smallest class by two orders of magnitude** (198k characters against
  10.3M). Its profile is thinner, and its higher error rate is partly that rather than
  anything about Python.
- **Snippets are cut at random offsets**, so many begin and end mid-token. That is realistic
  for a log line and unrealistic for a search query, and it makes the short-input numbers a
  lower bound.
- **`compression` uses an 8 KB context** per class, truncated so every class gets the same
  amount. A larger context would help it and cost time proportionally.
- **The profile size (400 n-grams) and n-range (1–5) are Cavnar & Trenkle's**, applied
  unchanged to all three methods so they see identical input. Naive Bayes in particular would
  usually be given the full count table rather than a truncated ranking.
- **No confidence threshold.** Every method must answer. A real identifier would decline
  below some margin, and the interesting question at ten characters is what fraction it
  should decline — which is not measured here.

## Run it

```bash
python src/run.py            # the full sweep, 34 seconds
python src/run.py --quick    # fewer samples
pytest -q                    # 26 tests, no dataset, no network
```

## Layout

```
src/identify.py  n-grams, profiles, and the three decision rules
src/run.py       the length sweep and the confusion matrix
results/         language_id.json
```
