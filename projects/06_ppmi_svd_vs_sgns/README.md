Levy & Goldberg (2014) proved that skip-gram with negative sampling, at its optimum, is
factorising a word-context matrix whose cells are

```
M[w, c] = PMI(w, c) - log k
```

with `k` the number of negative samples. The neural model is not learning a different kind
of representation. It is computing a shifted PMI matrix and factorising it implicitly.

Levy, Goldberg & Dagan (2015) followed that with the practical claim: most of what
separates a neural word embedding from a counting model is not the objective but a handful
of preprocessing and weighting decisions that shipped with the neural implementations and
were never applied to the counting ones.

This project transfers those decisions one at a time and measures each.

## Results

> ### After transferring word2vec's hyperparameters, a pure counting model is statistically indistinguishable from SGNS — across two independent runs, p = 0.969 and p = 0.331. Nothing separates them but the hyperparameters.

5,929,439 tokens of HotpotQA paragraphs, 66,581 documents, 1,000 questions, 300 dimensions,
one shared 20,000-word vocabulary. No gradient is computed anywhere on the counting side.

| Configuration | recall@10 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|
| PPMI + SVD, as usually taught | 0.118 | — |
| + dynamic context window | 0.107 | **−0.011** |
| + subsample frequent words | 0.193 | +0.074 |
| + context distribution smoothing | 0.194 | +0.076 |
| + shifted PMI (k = 5) | 0.311 | **+0.193** |
| + eigenvalue weighting p = 0.5 | **0.371** | **+0.253** |
| + add context vectors (w + c) | 0.326 | **−0.045** |

| | run A | run B |
|---|---:|---:|
| SGNS, 5 epochs | 0.088 | 0.081 |
| **SGNS, 25 epochs** | **0.3715** | **0.380** |
| **best counting model** | **0.371** | **0.371** |
| difference | −0.001 [−0.019, +0.017] | −0.009 [−0.027, +0.009] |
| p | 0.969 | 0.331 |
| verdict | **within noise** | **within noise** |

**Two independent runs are shown because SGNS is not reproducible here.** gensim trains with
four worker threads whose updates interleave, so a rerun moves the result — and it moves it
in the second decimal (0.3715 to 0.380), not the third. The counting side is deterministic
and returns 0.371 both times.

The conclusion survives the variation, which is the point of showing it: the confidence
interval spans zero in both runs and the difference is not significant in either. What does
*not* survive is quoting a single run's −0.001 as though it were the measurement. The honest
statement is that **the two methods are indistinguishable on this task, with the gap moving
between −0.001 and −0.009 depending on how the threads happened to interleave.**

**The textbook counting model reaches about a third of what SGNS achieves. The same counting
model with word2vec's hyperparameters matches it.** Tripling the baseline took no change of
objective, no neural network and no training — only decisions that were published alongside
word2vec and never applied to the thing it was compared against.

### Which decision did the work

**The negative-sampling shift is the single largest transfer (+0.193 on its own).** It is
also the one that looks least like a modelling choice: `k` reads as an optimisation detail
of how negative examples are drawn, and Levy & Goldberg's derivation shows it is a term in
the objective — `log k` subtracted from every cell. Applied to a counting model it is one
line, and it is worth more than every other transfer combined.

**Two of the seven rungs made things worse.** The dynamic context window cost 0.011, and
adding the context vectors cost 0.045 from the peak. Both are standard recommendations;
neither survives on this task. They are reported as measured rather than dropped from the
ladder, because a ladder that only contains the rungs that worked is not an ablation.

**SGNS at 5 epochs scores 0.08; at 25 epochs it scores 0.37–0.38.** Project 01's `Word2Vec`
retriever — and many tutorials — use 5. On a corpus this size that setting is not a weak
result, it is a broken one, and a comparison against it would have flattered the counting
side by about 0.29.

### Do the two spaces hold the same words together?

Matching on a task is weak evidence that two methods learned the same thing — two mediocre
spaces can score alike for different reasons. So the top-10 neighbour sets are compared
directly, over the 2,000 most frequent shared words. This needs no gold data at all.

| Counting model | mean Jaccard@10 with SGNS | words with no overlap |
|---|---:|---:|
| PPMI + SVD, as usually taught | **0.397** | 1.1% |
| + eigenvalue weighting p = 0.5 (best) | 0.321 | 2.1% |

**Two of every five nearest neighbours are shared, and almost no word's neighbourhood is
disjoint** — the direct prediction of the implicit-factorisation result, measured rather
than inferred from matching scores.

The second row is the interesting one. **The configuration that matches SGNS on the task
agrees with it *less* about which words are alike** (0.321 against 0.397). Equal task
performance is not the same space. Whatever the eigenvalue weighting is doing for retrieval,
it is moving the geometry away from SGNS's, not towards it — so "the counting model caught
up" and "the counting model reproduces word2vec" are two different claims, and only the
first one is supported here.

```

**One vocabulary for both sides.** The counting side caps its vocabulary to keep a V×V
matrix tractable; gensim caps its own by `min_count` and arrives at a different set.
Compared as trained, one method could embed words the other cannot read, and the retrieval
score would be partly a coverage score. Both sides are restricted to the intersection
before anything is scored. That is why SGNS is trained *first* — its vocabulary is an input
to the comparison, not an output of it.

**SGNS gets a fair run.** Hyperparameters match project 01's `Word2Vec` retriever exactly
(300 dimensions, window 5, `min_count` 2, 5 negative samples, seed 0), and it is trained at
both 5 and 25 epochs with the better of the two reported. A neural baseline deliberately
starved of epochs would make the counting side look good for the wrong reason.

**Every rung changes one thing.** Each configuration inherits the one above it and alters a
single decision, so the delta on a row is attributable to the name on that row.

**Pooling is the crudest available** — the mean of the word vectors present, unit
normalised, identical to project 01's. The question is what the *matrix* buys, not what a
better pooling strategy buys.

## Limitations

- **Retrieval, not word similarity.** WordSim-353, SimLex-999 and the Google analogy set
  are the usual intrinsic evaluations and none is in the local cache; downloading them
  would make this the one project in the lab that needs a dataset. Recall@10 is a coarser
  instrument, and it cannot see the analogy result — which is exactly where Levy & Goldberg
  report that SGNS stays ahead of SVD. **Nothing here tests analogies, so nothing here
  contradicts that.**
- **Not comparable with project 01's table.** That project scores on `build(300)`, 2,964
  paragraphs. This one needs a far larger corpus to train embeddings on at all and uses all
  66,581. Recall@10 depends on how many documents the gold two are hiding among, so only
  the numbers within this project may be compared with each other.
- **The vocabulary cap is a tractability bound.** The co-occurrence matrix is V×V and the
  corpus has 160,743 types. Capping changes what the tail of the PMI matrix contains, and
  the cap is reported rather than hidden.
- **The ladder is one order.** Each rung inherits the one above it, so a decision's measured
  value is its value *given* the ones already applied. A different order could attribute
  the gains differently; interactions are not separated here, which is the same caveat
  project 02 raises about preprocessing steps that do not compose.
- **SGNS with four workers is not bit-reproducible, and the drift is larger than a rounding
  error.** gensim's threads interleave updates; two runs gave 0.3715 and 0.380 — the second
  decimal. That is why the comparison is reported across two runs rather than one, and why
  the claim is "indistinguishable" rather than a specific gap. `workers=1` would make a
  25-epoch run over six million tokens slow enough to discourage rerunning it at all, which
  is the trade being made.
- **5.9 million tokens is a small corpus for word embeddings.** Both sides are handicapped
  by it, and neither result should be read as what either method does at scale.

## Run it

```bash
python src/run.py            # every table above
python src/run.py --quick    # a tenth of the corpus, 150 dimensions
pytest -q                    # tests, no dataset, no network
```

`gensim` is an optional extra (`uv sync --extra sgns`). Without it the counting ladder still
runs and the SGNS rows are skipped.
