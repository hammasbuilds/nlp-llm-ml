## What the reference is, and is not

HotpotQA ships each paragraph pre-split into sentences. That segmentation was produced by a
**tool, not a person**.

So this project measures **agreement with a reference segmentation, not accuracy.** Nothing
here can say which splitter is right, because nothing here knows. Reporting an F1 against it
as though it were a gold standard would be the exact error project 05 is about — a number
that looks like a measurement and is an artefact of how it was produced.

It is still worth measuring, and the honest framing makes a better question: sentence
splitting is treated as settled preprocessing, so **if reasonable implementations disagree,
the choice of splitter is an unreported parameter of every downstream result.**

## Results

61,775 paragraphs, 203,021 reference boundaries. (The corpus holds 66,581 paragraphs; the
4,806 that HotpotQA splits into a single sentence contain no boundary to agree about and
are excluded.) Four splitters, each the previous one plus a restriction:

| Splitter | precision | recall | F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| naive — split on any `.` `!` `?` | 0.905 | 0.982 | 0.942 |
| + supplied abbreviation list | 0.928 | 0.979 | 0.953 |
| + list *learned* from the corpus | 0.913 | 0.979 | 0.945 |
| + require a sentence-like next token | **0.940** | 0.974 | **0.957** |

**The spread is 0.015.** Four implementations that a methods section would describe
identically as "sentences were split", and the distance between the crudest and the most
careful is a point and a half.

**Learning the abbreviation list makes things worse than supplying one** (0.945 against
0.953) — and not for lack of material. It learned **40 tokens against the supplied 35.** It
learned *different* ones.

Punkt's rule is that an abbreviation is a token bound to its trailing period. On this corpus
that rule finds two populations:

- **Real abbreviations the supplied list lacks** — `calif`, `capt`, `sgt`, `tsgt`, `spp`,
  `subsp`, `translit`, `pgs`. A genuine win, and the reason the idea is attractive.
- **Nouns that happen to end sentences** — `boraginaceae`, `geometridae`, `primulaceae`,
  `thymelaeaceae`. Latin family names, which in this corpus appear almost exclusively at the
  end of *"…is a species in the family Boraginaceae."* They are bound to a period by exactly
  the evidence a real abbreviation is bound by, and the splitter then **refuses to split
  after them**. Alongside them: `www`, `sherdog`, `fasterlouder`, `o'herlihy`, `mrjims`.

And it **misses 28 of the 35 supplied abbreviations**, including the commonest ones —
`mr`, `ms`, `prof`, `st`, `co`, `corp`, `vs`, `ie`, `eg`, `al`, `dept`. In encyclopaedic
prose those appear too seldom, or too often without a period, to clear the threshold.

The cost shows up directly in the taxonomy below: the trained splitter still makes **3,571
known-abbreviation errors** where the supplied list makes **zero**.

So the unsupervised method does not need "a bigger corpus" — this one is 61,775 paragraphs.
It needs a corpus where the abbreviations that matter are both frequent *and* consistently
bound, and where no ordinary noun is systematically sentence-final.
`test_learning_over_fits_a_small_corpus` asserts the failure mode directly.

## The one construction that matters

False boundaries, by what is on either side of them:

| Construction | naive | + list | + learned | + conservative |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **single initial** | **13,892** | **13,892** | **13,849** | **11,208** |
| known abbreviation | 5,404 | **0** | 3,571 | **0** |
| other | 1,088 | 1,088 | 1,004 | 1,058 |
| quote or bracket follows | 297 | 297 | 295 | 297 |
| lowercase follows | 118 | 118 | 118 | **0** |
| number before period | 59 | 59 | 59 | 59 |
| exclamation or question | 42 | 42 | 42 | 11 |
| **TOTAL** | **20,900** | 15,496 | 18,938 | **12,633** |

**Single initials are 66.5% of the naive splitter's errors, and every refinement fails on
them.** `J. R. R. Tolkien`, `Ed Wood Jr.`, `Harry S. Truman` — three boundaries invented per
name.

Why each fix misses:

- **The abbreviation list** cannot help: `J` is not an abbreviation of anything, it is a
  name. No list contains every letter of the alphabet, and one that did would refuse to
  split after any single-letter sentence.
- **The learned list** cannot help either, for the same reason and more weakly.
- **Requiring a capital next** cannot help, because the token after `J.` is `R.` — also
  capitalised. It removes 19% of them and no more.

The abbreviation list *does* completely solve the construction it was built for — 5,404
errors to zero. It is simply not the construction that dominates. **Every splitter here
spends its sophistication on the second-largest problem.**

## Limitations

- **Agreement, not accuracy.** Stated above and worth repeating: the reference is a tool's
  output. A splitter that disagreed with it by being *right* would score worse here.
- **One register.** Wikipedia introductions. They are unusually full of names with initials,
  which is exactly the construction that dominates — a legal or clinical corpus would have a
  different leading error, and a news corpus fewer initials and more quotations.
- **The tolerance is one character.** HotpotQA's sentences carry a leading space, so a
  boundary placed before or after it is the same decision written differently, and scoring
  those as errors would measure whitespace convention. A larger tolerance would hide real
  disagreements.
- **Four splitters, none of them modern.** No Punkt proper, no spaCy, no neural segmenter.
  The point is the spread between reasonable simple choices and the shape of what defeats
  them, not a leaderboard.
- **The learned-abbreviation threshold (0.85) and minimum count (4) are parameters** that
  were set once and not tuned. Tuning them on this corpus would make the learned list look
  better than it deserves.
- **`other` is 1,088 errors** and is not broken down further. Some of those are genuine
  disagreements worth a category of their own.
